# San-Fransicso-Crime-Classification-PySpark
## Introduction

From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.

Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.

From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this competition's dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. Given time and location and we need to predict the category of the crime.

I've used PySpark to tackle this problem and you can find below Kaggle link for this competition which includes the data used for our analysis
